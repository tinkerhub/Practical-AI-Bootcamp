# Medical x-ray detection using cnn
   Prediction of x-ray chest to tell it's normal or pneumonia affected.

# What will you learn
This project much good in learning CNN application and it's a good project to showcase

# Dataset for the project
Dataset used in this project is taken from kaggle and I used Kaggle API to connect Json file downloaded to authorize connection of dataset to Google colab.The dataset contain normal and pneumonia affected X-ray images,using this apply CNN to predict whether given X-ray is Normal or not.

# What algorithms and frameworks you could use
Suggestion for algorithms and tools to use to do the project
